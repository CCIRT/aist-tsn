# AIST-TSN

AIST-TSN is an open source project developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. It focuses on enabling hardware design support for Time Sensitive Network (TSN) technology. 
TSN is a set of IEEE standards that extends Ethernet to support real-time, deterministic communication â€” essential for applications in industrial automation, automotive systems, and cyber-physical infrastructure.
This repository provides design assets, reference implementations, verification tools, and evaluation experiments for TSN features targeting FPGA or ASIC-based hardware development. 
The project aims to accelerate TSN adoption by offering reusable, standards-aligned components and resources for developers, researchers, and system integrators.
We aim to provide an open platform that can be used as a reference design so scientists can implement their desired functionalities and make the different evaluations and comparisons to highlight the appropriate design choices for a given TSN system.

## Design
### [AIST TSN SWITCH](https://github.com/CCIRT/aist-tsn-switch)
This repository introduces the hardware design of a reconfigurable architecture of an FPGA-based an L2 network switch supporting Time Sensitive Networks (TSN). 
It supports two different scheduling algorithms which are implemented and validated on an AMD Xilinx KC705 FPGA evaluation board:

- L2 switch supporting Credit Based Shaper (CBS):
- L2 switch supporting Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS)

### [AIST EFCC](https://github.com/CCIRT/aist-tsn-efcc) 
This repository includes Ethernet Frame Crafter & Capture (EFCC), a flexible FPGA-based frame generation and capture measurement tool for TSN research and developement. 
EFCC is capable of generating multiple TSN flows with different characteristics, where the frame size, frame rate, and burst size are independently set for each flow. 
In addition, it can record the arrival times of all the frames with a high-precision hardware clock without any loss of the arrival time records, even with the shortest frame size.
EFFC is implemented and validated on an AMD Xilinx KC705 FPGA evaluation board.
